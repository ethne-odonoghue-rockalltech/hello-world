Hello

I've added some text here to illustrate making a change to a file, and then ... WHOOPS!

This text was added to the test1 branch.

I've added some text here to illustrate making a change to a file, and then committing it.

Added some text to the test2 branch of README.md, on the same line as the test1 branch has different text added.

This text is for the old branch and the new branch. (commit 2)

Test6 text at end

Here's some text that's for the new branch only. (commit 1)
