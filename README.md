Hello

I've added some text here to illustrate making a change to a file, and then ... WHOOPS!

This text was added to the test1 branch.

I've added some text here to illustrate making a change to a file, and then committing it.

Added some text to the test2 branch of README.md, on the same line as the test1 branch has different text added.

Test6 text at end

Added text to Branch A. Can I keep working on this file in branch A, and another file in branch B?

Here is some completely different text for branch A. This should cause a conflict if merging branch B into master after merging branch A into master. 
Branch A should be zipped up on the release page before it's added to master or deleted. 
When Branch B is merged with master (theoretically at end of next release), there'll be conflicts with the master, as branch B was created from branch A, not the master (as branch A wasn't ready to be merged with master when branch B needed to be created). 
Branch B should win.
